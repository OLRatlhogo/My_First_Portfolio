    <h2>About This Project</h2>
    <h3>Learning Goals</h3>

  
    <p>This portfolio is my first step into building and managing projects on GitHub.</p>
    <p>It demonstrates my growing skills in HTML, JavaScript, and version control workflows.</p>
    <p>Through this project, I am practicing proper coding standards and validation using official tools.</p>
    <p>My long-term goal is to expand this portfolio with more advanced projects and professional achievements.</p>
